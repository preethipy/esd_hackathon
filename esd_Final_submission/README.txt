Environment:

1) Development IDE IntelliJ IDEA 14.1.5 & Zeppelin
2) Programming language - Scala
3) Platform - SPARK
4) Build tools used sbt
5) The code was run on Zeppelin for quick data projection

Assumptions & Analysis:

1)Aix logs(viocmd, Ioscli, pool, syslog ...) are generated for 4 nodes (node1, node2, node3, and node4) 
2)Analyze the logs and interpret errors in the logs in two views both Horizontal and Vertical
3)Horizontal views show number of error instances in each node for a given layer/log
4)Vertical views show number of error instances in each layer for a given Node


Details for files shared:

1) The project is packaged as LogAnalysis_AIX.zip
2) The log_conf.txt file is used for parsing through the node folders shared
3) Pictures of both Horizontal and Vertical views are shared for each node/layer
4) The error string details are also captured in raw data format which is available ...
5) Json file - note.json is the file created by Zeppelin.
6) Pdf file with the snapshot of the code & output - Code_Output.pdf
